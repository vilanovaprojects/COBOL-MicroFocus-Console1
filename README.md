### Introduction

This is a COBOL Migration from DatosCliente-CICS-DB2 project to upgrade to visual cobol. For the cics migration, some views have been created in the "screen-section". The statements that belonged to DB2 have also been changed, since the project is made to be executed on Windows servers, the database has been migrated to MSSQL.
